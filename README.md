### MeteoriteMapMove Component

The source code for the `<MapMoveComponent/>` has been taken from Professor Jaya Nilakantan at Dawson College. 

## Configuration 

### MinZoom value.

The configuration of the minimum zoom in the `config.js` file is at a value of `5` since for any lower zoom values the rendering would take too long to load due to the size of the data set.

If you wish to see more of the map for evaluation you may need to change the value of minZoom in the `config.js` file within the `client/src/utils/config.js` path.
